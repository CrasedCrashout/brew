# Welcome to Elixir Studios' GBA Emulator!

We hope you enjoy over 50+ games! Found a bug? Feature request? Submit a ticket via the Support page!

Our games cannot be blocked, everything runs locally in your browser!

How to access games:
Go to the CODE button in the main branch of this repository
Select download as .zip
Download Visual Studio Code
In Visual Studio Code, find the extensions tab and download "Live Server"
Open the file you just downloaded
In the bottom right, click "Go Live"
If you followed all of these steps correctly, you should load into the Elixir Studios GBA Emulator

Please note that games do not save - we are working on a backend to fix this. The best solution to save data loss is to not close the tab or let your computer restart.
