# Welcome to Elixir Studios' GBA Emulator!

We hope you enjoy over 100+ games! Found a bug? Feature request? Game Request? Submit a ticket via the Support page!

We do not collect play data or personal info, everything runs locally in your browser!

How to access games:
1. Go to the github.com/CrasedCrashout/elixir-GBA/releases

2. Select download as .zip 

3. Download Visual Studio Code 

4. In Visual Studio Code, find the extensions tab and download "Live Server" 

5. Open the file you just downloaded in Visual Studio Code

6. In the bottom right, click "Go Live"

If you followed all of these steps correctly, you should load into the Elixir Studios GBA Emulator



Please note that games do not save - we are working on a backend to fix this. The best solution to save data loss is to not close the tab or let your computer restart.
